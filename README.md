# BunnyDNS - A lightweight .NET DNS Server Library
BunnyDNS is an ultra lightweight DNS server library written in C# with simplicity, performance and ease of use in mind.

### Work in progress
Please be aware that the BunnyDNS library is currently still a work in progress and still requires quite a lot of work and refractoring before being stable. 

The network code especially is extremely messy and is there mainly for testing purposes. It needs to be rewritten when the time comes.

This product includes GeoLite2 data created by MaxMind, available from http://www.maxmind.com
